# JavaScript Functionality Explanation

## Overview
This JavaScript code controls various functionalities on a web page. It includes toggling the menu, scrolling behavior, theme toggling, image gallery functionality, countdown timer, and Swiper sliders initialization.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Selection of DOM Elements
   - The code selects the HTML element with the class `.navbar` and stores it in the variable `navbar`.

### 2. Menu Toggle
   - When the element with the id `menu-bar` is clicked, the `active` class is toggled on the `navbar` element, controlling the menu's visibility.

### 3. Closing the Menu
   - When the element with the id `close` is clicked, the `active` class is removed from the `navbar` element, closing the menu.

### 4. Page Scrolling Control
   - On page scroll, the `active` class is removed from the `navbar` element. Additionally, if the user scrolls more than 100 pixels down, the `active` class is added to the `header` element. This can create a fixed header effect when the user scrolls down.

### 5. Theme Toggler
   - When the element with the id `theme-toggler` is clicked, the `fa-sun` class is toggled on the element. Depending on the presence of the `fa-sun` class, the `active` class is added or removed from the `body` element. This can be used to switch between light and dark themes.

### 6. Image Gallery
   - The code allows users to click on image thumbnails to display them in full size.

### 7. Countdown Timer
   - The code calculates the remaining time until a specific date (August 1, 2021) and dynamically updates HTML elements with the IDs `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds` to display the remaining time.

### 8. Swiper Sliders
   - The code initializes two Swiper sliders (carousel sliders). Each slider has specific settings such as the number of slides per view, space between slides, autoplay behavior, and breakpoints for responsive design.

## Usage
- This code can be integrated into a web project to enhance user experience and add dynamic functionality.
- Ensure that the necessary HTML structure is in place to interact with the JavaScript functions.
- Adjust the selectors and configurations as needed to fit the specific requirements of the project.

## Dependencies
- This code utilizes the Swiper library for slider functionality. Make sure to include the Swiper library in your project.
